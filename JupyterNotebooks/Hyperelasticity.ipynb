    "As explained in class, hyperelastic materials are those with an underlying strain energy potential. These materials have a stress field that is completely given by the current state of deformation and independently of the path of deformation.

For materials in this form the stress can be computed as $\\mathbf{S}=2\\partial\\Psi/\\partial \\mathbf{C}=\\partial \\Psi/\\partial \\mathbf{E}$; $\\mathbf{\\sigma} = 2\\mathbf{b}\\partial \\Psi/\\partial \\mathbf{b}$\n",

The deformation and strain derived quantities from this part of the deformation are $\\bar{\\mathbf{C}} = \\bar{\\mathbf{F}}^T\\bar{\\mathbf{F}}$ etc. The strain energy is then given as a sum from the isochoric part and the volumetric part: $\\Psi = \\Psi_{iso}(\\bar{I}_i)+\\Psi_{vol}(J)$ where $\\bar{I}_i$ are isochoric invariants. \n",

Instead, the energy can be thought of as a component from the invariants plus a Lagrange multiplier constraint: $\\Psi = \\Psi(I_i)+p(J-1)$ where the field $p$ is a Lagrange multiplier field, i.e. an generalized force corresponding to the constraint. In practice exact incompressibility can only be ensured in very specific loading such as plane stress. More likely, incomporessible behavior will be enforced approximately. In those cases, there will be still a Lagrange multiplier field but then the isochoric invariants are used: $\\Psi = \\Psi(\\bar{I}_i)+p(J-1)$ since $J~1$ but not exactly 1. \n",

Let's go back to the initial way we were discussing the problem, as a minimization problem for the deformation of a solid. We need to consider boundary conditions. For example, let's say we want to do biaxial deformation for a thin speciment, then we can say that our degrees of freedom are $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2$ the in plane stretches, and the normal stress $\\sigma_{33}=0$.

For a body with more complicated boundary conditions it is not easy. Just imagine that even without the constraint you have a nonlinear problem trying to minimize $\\Psi$ by finding the strain field $\\mathbf{C}$. Now we have to solve two equations simultaneously to get both the deformation field $\\mathbf{C}$ as well as the pressure field $p$.
