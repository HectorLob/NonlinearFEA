# Nonlinear Finite Element Analysis

Repository for nonlinear finite element analysis course, taught by Prof. Adrian Buganza Tepole 

This repository mainly contains the Jupyter notebooks used in the class.

## Module 1: Math fundamentals 

### Nonlinearities in solid mechanics 

* [Jupyter notebook](JupyterNotebooks/Nonlinearities_in_solid_mechanics.ipynb): code associated to *Video: Nonlinearities in solid mechanics*, as well as other examples not solved in the Video. The example from *Video: Hyperelastic example* is also solved in this notebook. Note that this notebook as some gaps for you to try to fill in. There are prompts in the notebooks to guide you along these examples on nonlinearities due to large displacements, nonlinear strains, and hyperelastic materials.  

* [Jupyter notebook (solution)](JupyterNotebooks/Nonlinearities_in_solid_mechanics_solution.ipynb): same code as the previous one but will all gaps filled in. 

### Solution of nonlinear equations

* [Jupyter notebook](JupyterNotebooks/Solution_of_nonlinear_equations_with_Newton-Raphson.ipynb): code associated to *Video: Solution of nonlinear equations using Newton Raphson*, as well as other examples not solved in the Video. There are prompts in the notebooks to guide you solve equations of one variable as well as systems of nonlinear equations with the Newton-Raphson algorithm.  

* [Jupyter notebook (solution)](JupyterNotebooks/Solution_of_nonlinear_equations_with_Newton-Raphson_solution.ipynb): same code as the previous one but will all gaps filled in. 

### Vector and tensor calculus 

* [Jupyter notebook](JupyterNotebooks/Vector_and_Tensor_Algebra.ipynb): code associated to *Video:  Vector basics*, *Video:  Second order tensors*, *Video:  Fourth order tensors*, as well as other examples not solved in the Videos. There are prompts in the notebooks to guide you to do coordinate transformations for vectors and tensors, computing dot products, cross products, invariants, and storing and applying four order tensors.  

* [Jupyter notebook (solution)](JupyterNotebooks/Vector_and_Tensor_Algebra_solution.ipynb): same code as the previous one but will all gaps filled in. 

### Motion and deformation gradient 

* [Jupyter notebook](JupyterNotebooks/Motion_and_Deformation_Gradient.ipynb): code associated to *Vide: Motion and deformation gradient*, as well as other examples not solved in the Video. This notebook will ask you to plot deforming grids and contours of length and area changes.  

* [Jupyter notebook (solution)](JupyterNotebooks/Motion_and_Deformation_Gradient_solution.ipynb): same code as the previous one but will all gaps filled in. 

### Velocities and accelerations  

* [Jupyter notebook](JupyterNotebooks/Velocities_Accelerations_Gradients_solution.ipynb): code associated to *Vide: Velocities, accelerations, gradients*, as well as other examples not solved in the Video. This notebook will ask you to plot particle trajectories, the corresponding velocity and acceleration vectors along the trajectory, and use that to generate the velocity and acceleration vectors in terms of material or spatial coordinates.   

* [Jupyter notebook (solution)](JupyterNotebooks/Velocities_Accelerations_Gradients_solution.ipynb): same code as the previous one but will all gaps filled in.
