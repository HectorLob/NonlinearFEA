# Nonlinear Finite Element Analysis

Repository for nonlinear finite element analysis course, taught by Prof. Adrian Buganza Tepole 

This repository mainly contains the Jupyter notebooks used in the class.

## Module 1: Math fundamentals 

### Nonlinearities in solid mechanics 

* [Jupyter notebook 1](JupyterNotebooks/Nonlinearities\ in\ solid\ mechanics.ipynb): code associated to *Video 1 Nonlinearities in solid mechanics*, as well as other examples not solved in the Video. The example from *Video 2 Hyperelastic example* is also solved in this notebook. Note that this notebook as some gaps for you to try to fill in. There are prompts in the notebooks to guide you.  

* Jupyter notebook 1 (solution):
